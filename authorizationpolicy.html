	Why do I need to authorize this site?

<p>The YouTube Data API requires users to authorize sites to use their account for some functions. The search feature on this site is one of those functions. YouTube may require this for several reasons, user security and monitoring use of their API being some of the possibilities. </p>

<p>Manage my account? What does this mean?</p>

<p>The YouTube Data API has many features that one can use with their account, such as uploading videos, doing resumable uploads and creating playlists. However, these are only possibilities, if a site were created to do these functions. AMVgenerator is not able to change your account settings, access your information, or upload videos.</p>

<p>So what does AMVgenerator do in terms of my account?</p>

<p>You will see the videos searched for in your history, as well as the videos for the songs. Thatâ€™s it!</p>

<p>Still unsure? You can check out all my code on <a href="https://github.com/hadleybanozac/atyoutubesumthin"> github! </a> And when you're done using the site, you can remove its permissions in your Google account settings</p>
